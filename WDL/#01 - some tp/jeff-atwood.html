	<h3>My Works:</h3>
	<p>
	I started a programming blog, Coding Horror, in 2004. As a result, I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>.
	<br><br>
	Later, on July 17, 2007, as a corollary to Tim Berners-Lee's Rule of Least Power, I proposed Atwood's Law, which states that "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." (which is now a meme.. which I am sorry for!).
	<br><br>
	And in 2008, together with Spolsky, we founded Stack Overflow, <s>a programming question-and-answer website</s>. You dont need any explanation for that. But its most used site, even more than Google.. (By developers i mean)!
	By the way, i am also the first user of StackOverflow... but not the most reputed one... thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet"> Jon Skeet</a>.
	<br><br>
	Then in February 2012, I left Stack Exchange so I could spend more time with my family... And started my new company <b>Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc.</b> (to big a name for company.. I know) which is <b><font color="red">"open source next-generation discussion platform called Discourse"</font></b> (thats every awesome word I could put together).
